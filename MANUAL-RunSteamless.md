## Using Steamless

### Steamless will remove the SteamStub DRM protection layer. If you do not do this, it will always prompt you for authorization to run Creation Kit with command line parameters, which gets pretty annoying when doing multiple patches. It also helps the script work properly as the script will not wait like it should if you get the prompts from Steam.
