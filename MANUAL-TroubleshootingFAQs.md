# Troubleshooting & FAQs

## FAQs

### How do I know if Precombines have been broken?
The easiest way is to open the plugin in xEdit and expand the Cell and/or Worldspace records. If any of the placed objects have brackets like this [Placed Object] then objects that were part of precombines have been edited. You can then check the VISI - PreVis Files Timestamp and PCMB - Precombined Files Timestamp to see if they have been regenerated by checking the dates. If previsibines have been regenerated, the brackets just mean that that item is part of the regenerated precombine meshes.
