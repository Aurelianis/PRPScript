### Error about missing registry entries when starting FO4Edit
You did not start Fallout 4 at least once after performing a clean install.

### How do I know if Precombines have been broken?
Easiest way is to open the plugin in xEdit and expand the Cell and/or Worldspace records. If any of the placed object have brackets like this [[Placed Object]] then precombines have been broken.
